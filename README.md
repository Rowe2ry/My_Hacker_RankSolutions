  ## Description  

  

  My Javascript solutions to the Hacker Rank problems in the 3 month interview prep course they offer for free to users.  

  * Motivation  

    I wanted to improve my algorithmic problem solving, and figured doccumenting my progress along the way as well as storing my solutions in a repo would give me or others reference in ways to think through the problems presented.  

  * Reason for Building  

    To create a reference library of my previous solutions. see motivation.  

  * Problems Solved  

    It gives me a snapshot of my Javascript skills and a way to track improvement.  

  * Things Learned  

    Lots of how to format Markdown files to match the HR instructions layout. More importantly, applying various array and string methods, loops, and if statements offered in JavaScript to problem solve.
